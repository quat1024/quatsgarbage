Quat's Garbage
==============

### What is this?

This is a personal mod intended for me to drop into most of my modpacks to make them more fun to play.

It's *extremely* geared towards my own tastes, and as such is not really intended for use by the "general public". Not much is configurable so you'll be stuck with my preferences. You'd be better off asking for a feature to be split off into its own mod, if you really want something.

The code is a right mess, mainly consisting of the source to other mods haphazardly glued together.

### "Feature" list

- Crowmap source code copy-pasted inside!!!
- Auto Third Person source code copy-pasted inside!!!
- Longer player reach (4 blocks)
- Faster player mining speed (40% faster)
- (a lot)% faster mining speed on obsidian
  - seriously, fuck obsidian, it's garbage
- Initialize vanilla/forge settings and keybinds on first run to my favorite settings lol
- Vanilla tools and armor do not take durability damage.
  - can be extended with regex to other mod items too
- Worldgen tweaks (very hacky):
  - No lakes.
  - Less grass.
  - More flowers.
  - More cacti.
  - More sugarcane.
  - Just more ore spawning in general (incl nether quarts)
  - More glowstone per glowstone pile on the ceiling of the Nether.
  - No lava pockets in the Nether.
  
### Will you put this on curse?

Fuck no

If you want something I'll split it off into its own, well-designed mod lmao
