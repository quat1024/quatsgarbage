Quat's Garbage
==============

### What is this?

This is a personal mod intended for me to drop into most of my modpacks to make them more fun to play.

It's *extremely* geared towards my own tastes, and as such is not really intended for use by the "general public". Not much is configurable so you'll be stuck with my preferences. You'd be better off asking for a feature to be split off into its own mod, if you really want something.

The code is a right mess, mainly consisting of the source to other mods haphazardly glued together.
